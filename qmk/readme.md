# Keymap Layout for Iris rev. 4

This layout was (mostly) generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data
used to generate this keymap in the file layers.json.

In addition, mouse keys are enabled in `rules.mk` and code added to `keymap.c`
to be able to use the encoder. It currently does the following:
- In the default layer, performs mouse wheel up and down, tap plays/pauses
- In layer 1, turns volume up and down
- In layer 2, changes RGB hue
