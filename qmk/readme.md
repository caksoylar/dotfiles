# Keymap Layout for Iris rev. 4

This is a mostly vanilla layout which was initially generated using the QMK
Configurator. Some additions were made to enable Ctrl+GUI key combinations and
the encoder. Mouse keys are enabled in `rules.mk` to use mouse wheel codes.

The encoder currently does the following:
- In the default layer, performs mouse wheel up and down, tap plays/pauses
- In layer 1, turns volume up and down
- In layer 2, changes RGB hue
